## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I'm Aadish 👋

I build automation systems, data-driven solutions, and product prototypes that solve real problems — fast.

Most of my work is hands-on: real execution, not theory. I love shipping end-to-end projects — from idea → research → prototype → deployment.

I also experiment with AI agents, product workflows, and automation frameworks (n8n, Slack automations, workflow systems, etc.) that reduce manual work and save hours for teams.

### 🚀 What I work on

- **Product & Data Projects:** turning vague problems into structured product solutions  
- **Automation (n8n, Slack, APIs):** workflow automation, integration across tools, scraping, logging workflows to sheets  
- **AI prototyping:** building agent-based systems, chatbots, and internal productivity tools  
- **Research + analytics:** structured problem breakdowns, dashboards, insights, problem solving  
- **Hands-on MVPs:** idea → rapid prototype → user testing → iteration

### 🛠 Projects I’ve built

- ✅ **Automated Ethereum Trading Bot** — built custom signals + automated trading workflow  
- ✅ **Slack workflow automation** — automatically logs unresponded tag mentions into Excel/Sheets  
- ✅ **ISRO research project** — *risk indexing system for ship navigation routes*  
- ✅ Multiple product decks & prototypes — showcasing UX flows, business logic, experiments
